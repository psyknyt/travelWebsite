This is a difficult trek and those adventure seekers who are serious about expanding their mountaineering pursuits embark upon this journey.",

You will be able to see the far reaches of the planet which are still untouched by human civilizations. Even though this is a difficult trek, strong determination always pays off and you will see yourself standing over the height of 6,000 m above sea level.",

        "Deoria Tal - Chopta Chandrashila trek is a very beautiful trek in India that any trekking lover would like to do. Especially for those who are beginners and would like to embark on the magnificent Himalayan treks. You get everything that you are looking for from the Garhwal Himalaya range out of this Deoria - Chandrashila trek. Therefore, if you see Deoria - Chandrashila as a wintry trek, you will be amazed to see such a pretty campsite view that is surrounded by an alluring lake, snow-capped Himalayan towering mountains just lying right before you.",

        "This Chandrashila trek can be a milestone journey of your life, located at a height of about 4000 m. The Tungnath temple is a center of attraction of Chandrashila trek, situated at the top. When you pass through Rohini Bugyal clearing in the middle of the forest, it stops you from moving to see such a beautiful landscape view. Alongside, when you reach up to the Birugali campsite, you get to see the snow line with the colorful wintry landscape. Reaching an altitude of 2438 meters, you get a chance to relish the charming beauty of Deoria Tal lake. In the forest trail from Deoria to Bhrujgali, you see a different variety of trees across the dense forest, moss-covered trails, and grassland.",

        "If you are a bird lover, then definitely this place will attract you a lot because this place is full of chirping of many birds. Sometimes you even do not get the voices of people standing nearby to you due to birds’ sounds. A five-day Deoriatal Chandrashila Trek has great things to offer you, whether seeing the real beauty of the Himalayan peaks that protect hamlets and ridges or a mesmerizing sunrise view from the top of the summit.",

        "A combination of Deoria Chandrashila is something that you look out for the adventurous and enthralled trek. Finally, climbing through the snow you reach the top of Chandrashila. The Sunrise view from the top is outstanding.",

        "Also, you can enjoy the picturesque sight view from Chandrashila peak of other peaks including Mt. Chaukhamba, Mt. Neelkantha, Mt. Bhagirathi, Mt. Trishul, and Mt. Maiktoli. When you see Mt. Nanda Devi, which is the highest summit with an altitude of 25,646 feet (7,817 meters), probably you get stunned after seeing the wonderful scenic view.",

        "The best time for doing the Chandrashila trek is winter because you get more things to experience. For snow trek, mid-December to the end of December. Try to ignore starting January to end February due to heavy snowfall. Then you can take a start from mid-March to the end of April still the snow is fully covering the landscape. The fabulous summit view is just breathtaking and you cannot stop yourself from capturing this great panorama.",
